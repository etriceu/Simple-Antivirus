# Simple-Antivirus
A very simple and shitty virus scanner.

# Usage
```antiVir [file]```

Example:

```antiVir infected```
  
# Info
The infected file is a real virus that I found on github (I don't remember where).
For safety, I damaged the file with the virus so that it wouldn't accidentally do any damage.
main.mdb file with virus signatures I stole from https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav

Note: You need to unpack the zip file before starting the program.
