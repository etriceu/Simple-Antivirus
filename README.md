# Simple-Antivirus
Very simple and shitty virus scanner

# Build
```g++ main.cpp -o main -o3 -lcrypto -fopenmp```

# Usage
```main [file]```

Example:

```main infected```
  
# Info
The infected file is a real virus that I found on github (I don't remember where).
For safety, I damaged the file with the virus so that it wouldn't accidentally do any damage.
main.mdb file with virus signatures I stole from https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav
